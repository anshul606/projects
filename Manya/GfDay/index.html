            If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you<br>
Drive highways and byways to be there with you<br>
Over and over the only truth<br>
Everything comes back to you<br>
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room<br>
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you<br>
Over and over the only truth<br>
Everything comes back to you❤️<br>
